<div class="bio">Named after two great men, Master Chief and Bill Murray, this dog brings a unique joy to everyone he meets. <br>Some say he's the textbook definition of a "dog with a personality", while other's say he's a prime example of <br>a dog that is exactly like their owner, <br>His name is Chief Master Bill Furry.
